Net::WMIClient version 0.62
======================

This module provides a pure perl interface to the WMI client from the wmi
package that does not require forking to execute wmic.  It requires that
lib_async_wmilib.so from the WMI package be installed, and that the
configured WMI source code be available at build time to provide the
required headers.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL (You will be prompted for the path to the WMI source)
   make
   make test
   make install

TESTING

By default, network tests are not done.  If you wish to do network tests
against a Windows machine, you need to create a Samba auth file with proper
credentials in it, and run 'make test' as follows:

   WMICLIENT_AUTHFILE=<path_to_auth_file> WMICLIENT_TESTHOST=<test_hostname> make test

That will run a few basic tests against the host using the specified credentials.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  lib_async_wmilib.so from the wmi package, along with the configured
  source code at build.  The current source is available at
  http://www.edcint.co.nz/checkwmiplus/wmi-1.3.14.tar.gz.
